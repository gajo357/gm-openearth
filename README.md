OpenEarth interview assignment

## Tree Tracking
A city government wants to encourage tree planting and maintenance on private property in
their city. The city wants a tool for private citizens to list information about trees on their property.
Each citizen has a name and a street address.
For each tree, important attributes include the tree species, the estimated year of planting,
height, trunk circumference.
The government will use aggregate data to plan future programs.

## Solution
Your job is to create a Web prototype of the tree tracking app.
* The citizen should be able to create and update their own name and street address.
* The citizen should be able to view the list of trees they’ve already entered.
* They should be able to view a tree’s record, add a new tree, delete a tree, and update a
tree.
* Stretch goal: add persistence (permanent data storage). What data storage platform did
you use? Why?
* Stretch goal: consider reporting for aggregate data for the city. What kind of output
would make sense?
* Stretch goal: consider other properties of a tree that might be useful to include, and add
them.
* Stretch goal: consider registration, login, and logout.

## Run & Build
To run localy:
```
npm run dev
```

To build the app (the output will be in the dist folder):
```
npm run build
```
